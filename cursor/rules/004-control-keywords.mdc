# Human Control Keywords

These keywords provide explicit control over the development workflow:

## Workflow Control

### NEXT_PHASE
- **Purpose**: Approve current phase and proceed to next
- **Usage**: Use when current implementation phase is complete and ready to advance
- **Effect**: AI will mark current phase as **COMPLETED** and begin next phase

### STOP
- **Purpose**: Pause all activity until further instruction
- **Usage**: Use when you need to halt development for review, planning, or external dependencies
- **Effect**: AI will cease all implementation activities and await explicit direction

### VIBE_REVIEW
- **Purpose**: Switch to review mode for current changes
- **Usage**: Use when you want the AI to review staged changes or recent implementations
- **Effect**: AI will analyze current state against specifications and provide feedback

## Usage Guidelines

- Keywords are case-sensitive and should be used exactly as shown
- Use keywords at the beginning of your message for clear intent
- Combine with additional context when needed (e.g., "REVIEW the authentication implementation")
- Keywords work across all AI tools and contexts within the project
