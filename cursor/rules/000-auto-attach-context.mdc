# Auto-Attach Context

Automatically include these essential project files for context:

- `docs/spec/*.md` - Tech Spec requirement
- `docs/implementation-plan.md` - Current implementation plan
- `docs/project-structure.md` - Project architecture overview

These files provide crucial context about the project structure, current implementation status, and API specifications that inform all development decisions.
