# Backend API & DB Specs

This repo hosts the **canonical template** (`template.md`) and reference
examples (`samples/`) for all backend feature specifications.

## How to use

1. **Copy** `template.md` into your feature branch (any service repo) or into
   Claude's GitHub picker.
2. **Fill** the placeholders manually *or* let Claude/Cursor auto-fill by also
   selecting relevant code files and past specs.
3. **Save** the completed spec as `docs/api/<feature>.md` in the service repo.
4. Open a PR â€“ reviewers confirm diagrams render & SQL lint passes.
